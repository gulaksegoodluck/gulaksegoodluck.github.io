											<h3>I. Liquidity</h3>
											<p>Unless you opt for close-ended mutual funds, it is relatively easier to buy and exit a mutual fund scheme. You can sell your units at any point (when the market is high). Do keep an eye on surprises like exit load or pre-exit penalty. Remember, mutual fund transactions happen only once a day after the fund house releases that day’s NAV.</p><br/>

											<h3>II. Diversification</h3>
											<p>Mutual funds have their share of risks as their performance is based on the market movement. Hence, the fund manager always invests in more than one asset class (equities, debts, money market instruments, etc.) to spread the risks. It is called diversification. This way, when one asset class doesn’t perform, the other can compensate with higher returns to avoid the loss for investors.</p>

											<h3>III. Expert Management</h3>
											<p>A mutual fund is favoured because it doesn’t require the investors to do the research and asset allocation. A fund manager takes care of it all and makes decisions on what to do with your investment. He/she decides whether to invest in equities or debt. He/she also decide on whether to hold them or not and for how long.

												Your fund manager’s reputation in fund management should be an essential criterion for you to choose a mutual fund for this reason. The expense ratio (which cannot be more than 1.05% of the AUM guidelines as per SEBI) includes the fee of the manager too.</p>

											<h3>IV. Less cost for bulk transactions</h3>
											<p>You must have noticed how price drops with increased volume when you buy any product. For instance, if a 100g toothpaste costs Rs.10, you might get a 500g pack for, say, Rs.40. The same logic applies to mutual fund units as well. If you buy multiple units at a time, the processing fees and other commission charges will be less compared to when you buy one unit.</p>

											<h3>V. Invest in smaller denominations</h3>
											<p>By investing in smaller denominations (SIP), you get exposure to the entire stock (or any other asset class). This reduces the average transactional expenses – you benefit from the market lows and highs. Regular (monthly or quarterly) investments, as opposed to lumpsum investments, give you the benefit of rupee cost averaging.</p>

											<h3>VI. Suit your financial goals</h3>
											<p>There are several types of mutual funds available in India catering to investors from all walks of life. No matter what your income is, you must make it a habit to set aside some amount (however small) towards investments. It is easy to find a mutual fund that matches your income, expenditures, investment goals and risk appetite.</p>
