											<section>
												<h3>I. Fixed income funds</h3>
												<p>These funds buy investments that pay a fixed rate of return like government bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds and high-yield corporate bonds. They aim to have money coming into the fund on a regular basis, mostly through interest that the fund earns. High-yield corporate bond funds are generally riskier than funds that hold government and investment-grade bonds.
												</p>
											</section>
										</div><br>
										
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<section>
												<h3>II. Equity funds</h3>
												<p>These funds invest in stocks. These funds aim to grow faster than money market or fixed income funds, so there is usually a higher risk that you could lose money. You can choose from different types of equity funds including those that specialize in growth stocks (which don’t usually pay dividends), income funds (which hold stocks that pay large dividends), value stocks, large-cap stocks, mid-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, or combinations of these.</p>
											</section>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<section>
												<h3>III. Balanced funds</h3>
												<p>These funds invest in a mix of equities and fixed income securities. They try to balance the aim of achieving higher returns against the risk of losing money. Most of these funds follow a formula to split money among the different types of investments. They tend to have more risk than fixed income funds, but less risk than pure equity funds. Aggressive funds hold more equities and fewer bonds, while conservative funds hold fewer equities relative to bonds.</p>
											</section>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<section>
												<h3>IV. Index funds</h3>
												<p>These funds aim to track the performance of a specific index such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index. The value of the mutual fund will go up or down as the index goes up or down. Index funds typically have lower costs than actively managed mutual funds because the portfolio manager doesn’t have to do as much research or make as many investment decisions.</p>
											</section>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<section>
												<h3>V. Specialty funds</h3>
												<p>These funds focus on specialized mandates such as real estate, commodities or socially responsible investing. For example, a socially responsible fund may invest in companies that support environmental stewardship, human rights and diversity, and may avoid companies involved in alcohol, tobacco, gambling, weapons and the military.</p>
											</section>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<section>
												<h3>VI. Fund-of-funds</h3>
												<p> These funds invest in other funds. Similar to balanced funds, they try to make asset allocation and diversification easier for the investor. The MER for fund-of-funds tend to be higher than stand-alone mutual funds.</p>
