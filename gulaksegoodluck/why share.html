												<h3>II. Capital Growth:</h3>
												<p>Investment in equities/ shares leads to capital appreciation. The longer is the duration of investment, the higher the returns. Investment in stocks is associated with risks as well. Your risk appetite is based on your age, dependants and need. If you are young and don’t have any dependants, you can invest more in equities to get more yield. But if you have dependants and commitments, you can allocate more portion of money to bonds and less to equity. </p>
