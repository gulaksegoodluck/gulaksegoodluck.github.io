									<h4><p>The concept of SIP focuses around the philosophy of “Save First, Spend Next”.
										With SIP you can invest small amounts at fixed intervals ( weekly, monthly or quarterly) instead of doing a one-time investment.</p></h4><br/>

												<h3>I. Power of Compounding</h3>
												<p>The basic principle of Compound interest implies that small amounts invested over a long period of time would result in a larger return compared to a one-time investment.</p><br/>

												<h3>II. Start with just Rs 500</h3>
												<p>You can start investing in mutual funds through an SIP with amount as low as Rs 500 and still not feel a burden on your budget planning. Generally, over a period of time you can increase your monthly installments by a factor of 15%. </p>

												<h3>III. Rupee Cost Averaging</h3>
												<p>The equity market is volatile in nature and when you do an SIP investment, you would be buying more number of units during a slump and less number of units in a blooming market and as a result you would decrease the cost per unit. </p>
